# SP-X lab creation with Terraform

This Terraform code creates a base topology to be used as a SP network. It contains PE, P, ASBR and RR-PCE devices.

Please adjust each variable to fit on your environment.


After deploying the lab and it's up and accessible via console, don't forget to run "crypto key generate rsa" on each device
